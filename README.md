# reactTestApp

## App installing

### I hope you have nodejs installed on your machine,
### in other way install the latest version from nodejs.org
### Let's start installing the app

  1) create new folder or move to existing one(shold be nothing inside)
  2) open your terminal or console and move there ('cd [folder path]' for win cmd)
  3) run command 'git init' for prepearing your folder to be a local repository
  4) run command 'git pull [this project url]'  
  
### If everything is OK, you folder should contain files of this repo.
### Now you need to install node modules. You can do it by the next steps:

  5) in your console run command: 'npm install' (can spend some time)
  
### Now you should have a new folder with files named node_modules in your folder

  6) run command 'npm run build'
##### !!! I received an error "'cp' is not recognized as an internal or external command"
##### To resolve this problem I installed cygwin terminal on my machine (from cygwin.com) 
##### and runned last command ones again in this terminal (for moving to app destination use 'cd /cygdrive/c/Desktop/appFolder' syntax)

### If you're done and everything is OK, you should receive in your console an address (http://localhost:8080 for ex)
### Open it in your browser and have fun with this app)
